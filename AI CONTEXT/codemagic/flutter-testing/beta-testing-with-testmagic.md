Codemagic is seamlessly integrated with [Testmagic](https://testmagic.io/), a simple mobile app for viewing, testing and distributing your Codemagic builds. You can download it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.nevercode.testmagic&hl=en) for Android or join the TestFlight group for iOS - [link](https://testflight.apple.com/join/lEQLSjoe).

With Testmagic, you can:

- Instantly get notified when a build is finished on Codemagic
- Download app binaries on your device
- Report feedback and screenshots about the build back to Codemagic
- View the reported feedback in the build overview on Codemagic
- Distribute app binaries by sharing a download link

To get started with Testmagic, see the step-by-step guide on our [blog](https://blog.codemagic.io/getting-started-with-testmagic/ 'Getting started with Testmagic').
